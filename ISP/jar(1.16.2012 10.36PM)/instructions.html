See the following diagram: <img src="sudokuBoard.png" alt="An empty sudoku grid" width="326" height="346" border="0"><BR> The objective of sudoku is to enter a digit from 1 through 9 in each cell, in such a way that:<BR> </p>

<ul>
<li>Each horizontal <strong>row</strong> (shown in pink) contains each digit exactly <strong>once</strong></li>
<li>Each vertical <strong>column</strong> (shown in yellow) contains each digit exactly <strong>once</strong></li>
<li>Each subgrid or <strong>region</strong> (shown in green) contains each digit exactly <strong>once</strong></li>
